 <li><strong>Coding exercise steps (Hint: Need help? Ask your tutor via Canvas→Discussions→”IIE12″):</strong></li>

 <li>Create a project named ‘IIE12’ or similar which follows the Assignment 3 structure (i.e. Application, BackEnd, FrontEnd…, etc.) so that, if your other application were the student manager (the application used by the university staff), this new one allows a student to login and edit their own details. Both back ends (projects) should read from the same “master” database (this violates A3 requirements but it is permitted for this task).</li>

 <li>Create a discussion forum post <strong>(do not attach files)</strong> with approximately the same algorithm, first implemented in Python and then in Java. (Your Python program does not need to run or be syntactically valid). Both programs should contain at least an if-statement and a while-loop. Alternatively do or optionally add another, the same algorithm implemented in C and Java.</li>

Tip: Find an existing Python program online by searching in Google using the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en"><em> </em></a><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en"><em>filetyp</em></a><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en"><em>  </em></a><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en"><em>e:py</em></a><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en"><em>  </em></a><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35287?hl=en">operator</a>  in your Google search query then translate it to Java by yourself. Remember to give a full reference using the IEEE referencing style. Ask your tutor questions if you have any. If your tutor asks questions, you must reply to them
